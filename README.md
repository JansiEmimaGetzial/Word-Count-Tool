# Word-Count-Tool
This is a Word Count Tool where one can tyoe in their file name and the number of words in the file will be shown as the output.
For that:
I created def word_read(file_name) to read the file which wll return the nu of words in the file
If the filr which is not present in the folder, FileNotFoundError exception will work.
